If you're a web developer you probably heard about [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). In this post I'll explain what is it and why you should consider using it.

## What is Vite?
Vite is a tool created by Evan You (creator of Vue.js) with a focus on simplify and speed-up the development. It consists of two parts:
- A development server that provides feature enhancements over native ES modules: lightning fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR), pre-bundling, support for TypeScript, JSX, TSX and dynamic imports.
- A build command that bundles code with Rollup and outputs optimized static assets for production.


## Why Vite?
Before ES modules became available, developers had no way to modularize a JavaScript app in a native way. Tools like Webpack, Rollup or Parcel, helped us with this but problems started to appear when applications became larger and complex. Long waiting times to run a dev server or edit files are common in this cases.

So here is when Vite enters in scene. By making use of native ESM it improves server start time and also HMR time.

**Server start**: usually when starting a dev server all the files of your application are bundled and served. Vite takes a different approach, it divides the modules in two categories:
- *Dependencies*. Vite pre-bundles these using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) (a Go written bundler 10-100x times faster than JavaScript written ones)
- *Source code*. Vite serves it over native ESM, this means that the browser does part of the job of a classic bundler. This way Vite only needs to transform and serve source code when the browser requests it.

**Updates with HMR**:
